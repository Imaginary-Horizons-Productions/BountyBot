# BountyBot Change Log
## BountyBot Version 2.6.0:
### Items
Items are consumables that are associated with a Discord account (rather than a server). They drop from bounties and do cool things when used.
- Added Profile Colorizers: these come in many different colors and allow you to change the color of your profile in the server they're used in

### Balance
- A toast's raiser is no longer considered recieving secondings on that toast.
   - This lead to weird incentives to be the first to toast an event/achievement to get the secondings and not second toasts by competitors.
   - In the case of raising a toast to all members of a group from within a group, having someone else raise a toast to the first toast's raiser will achieve the same effect.
