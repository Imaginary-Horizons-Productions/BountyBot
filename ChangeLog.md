# BountyBot Change Log
## BountyBot Version 2.10.0:
### User Options in Slash Commands
Slash commands originally accepted users as a string (instead of Discord's user filtering) to allow users to mention as many users as they wanted. However, this doesn't work on mobile, so those slash commands have been remade to use Discord's user filtering.
- `/toast` now requires 1 toastee and up to 4 optional ones. The `message` option has been changed to the first option to group the toastee options.
- `/bounty add-completers` has been renamed to `/bounty verify-turn-in` and now requires 1 bounty hunter and up to 4 optional ones.
- `/bounty complete` now accepts up to 5 optional hunters.
### Other Changes
- Added `/seasonal-ranks`, which allows all bounty hunters to look up the server's list of seasonal ranks (removed `/rank info` which was only usable by Premium users)
- Fixed BountyBot banned users being able to receive toasts

## BountyBot Version 2.9.0:
### Server Goals
Server Goals are BountyBot objectives everyone on the server contributes to. A goal can require bounty completions, toasts, or toast secondings, with numbers depending on active bounty hunters on your server. A goal can be started by a bounty hunter using a Goal Initializer item on your server, and will reward contributors to the goal with XP and double item find on their next bounty completion. Server Goal progress can be found on the scoreboard. The bounty hunter with the most Server Goal contributions will receive a shoutout at the end of the season.

### Other Changes
- New items: Goal Initializer, Progress-in-a-Can
- New commands: `/moderation revoke-contributions`, `/moderation revoke-goal-bonus`
- Added Festival and Raffle indicators to the scoreboard, removed /server-bonuses
- Fixed crashes when toasting, completing bounties, or seconding toasts in threads
- Added an optional text input for `/evergreen showcase` to allow moderators to add text to the showcase message
- Fixed `/bounty edit` and `/evergreen edit` not saving modifications
- Fixed crash when using `/create-default rank-roles` twice in a row
- Fixed `/moderation user-report` listing XP awarded for recent bounties as "undefined"
- Fixed Dark Purple Profile Colorizer not dropping
- Item drops are now limited to 2 items per day, or 4 items for Premium users

## BountyBot Version 2.8.0:
### Context Menu Options

   - Raise a Toast
   - Grant Bounty Credit
### End of Season Shoutouts
When a season ends, the following bounty hunters will be recognized in the end of season message:
- The hunter placed \#1 in season xp
- The hunter who posted the most bounties completed in the season
- The hunter who raised the most toasts in the season
### New Items
- Bonus Bounty Showcase: allows the hunter to showcase and increase the reward on one of their bounties on a separate cooldown from the command
- Bounty Thumbnail: allows a bounty's poster to add a thumbnail image to one of their bounties (also increasing completion XP for the poster)
### Other Changes
- Fixed `/bounty complete` mentioning the bounty board instead of the completed bounty's thread
- Fixed a bug where bounty posters were receiving item drops completers were stated to have recieved
- Converted all Light Green Profile Colorizers (which were unusable) to Light Grey Profile Colorizers

## BountyBot Version 2.7.1:
- Added cooldowns to items, these are applied per user
- Fixed a crash when using XP Boosts
- Fixed a crash when looking up Light Grey Profile Colorizers

## BountyBot Version 2.7.0:

- Added a label for when a toast or seconding is a critical toast (awards the toaster XP)
- Adding completers to a bounty now sends a public message in the bounty board's thread (if it exists)
- Removing completers from a bounty now sends a public message in the bounty board's thread (if it exists)
- Editing a bounty now sends a message to mark the time of the edit in the bounty board's thread (if it exists)

## BountyBot Version 2.6.0:
### Items
Items are consumables that are associated with a Discord account (rather than a server). They drop from bounties and do cool things when used.
- Look up which items you've found with `/inventory` then use them with `/item`
- Added Profile Colorizers: these come in many different colors and allow you to change the color of your profile in the server they're used in

### Other Changes
- A toast's raiser is no longer considered recieving secondings on that toast.
   - This lead to weird incentives to be the first to toast an event/achievement to get the secondings and not second toasts by competitors.
   - In the case of raising a toast to all members of a group from within a group, having someone else raise a toast to the first toast's raiser will achieve the same effect.
- Fixed crashes when using bounty board thread buttons
