# BountyBot Change Log
## BountyBot Version 2.7.0:
- Added the ability to customize embed thumbnails per server in `/config-premium`
- `/item` now previews the color of Profile Colorizers in its own embed
- Fixed a bug where a hunter would gain XP for seconding a toast they were originally a recipient of
- Added a label for when a toast or seconding is a critical toast (awards the toaster XP)
- Editing a bounty now sends a message to mark the time of the edit in the bounty board's thread (if it exists)
- Fixed several crashs when handling bounties lacking descriptions

## BountyBot Version 2.6.1:
- Added XP Boosts: use them to gain XP in the used server
- The bot now announces when a bounty has been completed publically (so other bounty hunters know)
- The complete button on the bounty board now takes an input of a which channel to announce the bounty's completion in
- Completing a bounty without a bounty board now stows rewards lists in a thread

## BountyBot Version 2.6.0:
### Items
Items are consumables that are associated with a Discord account (rather than a server). They drop from bounties and do cool things when used.
- Look up which items you've found with `/inventory` then use them with `/item`
- Added Profile Colorizers: these come in many different colors and allow you to change the color of your profile in the server they're used in

### Other Changes
- A toast's raiser is no longer considered recieving secondings on that toast.
   - This lead to weird incentives to be the first to toast an event/achievement to get the secondings and not second toasts by competitors.
   - In the case of raising a toast to all members of a group from within a group, having someone else raise a toast to the first toast's raiser will achieve the same effect.
- Fixed crashes when using bounty board thread buttons
